### Decentralized Voting Machine

This platform is built on Ethereum Blockchain that uses "Votes"  as tokens.
<br>
Why combine Elections & Blockchain? <br>
Using the power of "Proof of Algortihm" no one can hack the Voting machine and using this method we can have an immutable legitimate record of elections conducted <br>

So the overview of the platform can be given such <br>

1. UIDAI Validation using Aadhar ID & OTP, making sure that one user can only vote once. <br>
2. Upon successfull login, the user will be taken to main platform wherein the users can vote for the candidate that they deem worthy. If the user doesn't have a proper idea about the candidate, (s)he can make use of "What does India think?" module. <br>
3. WDIT is a machine learning based sentiment analysis, which perform a quick run on the stats and shows which party/candidate are people supporting or are against.
